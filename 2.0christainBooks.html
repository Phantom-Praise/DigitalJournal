          <h1>I Declare War By Levi Lusko </h1>
          <p>
            Declare war on the version of yourself that you don't want to be!
            Bad things happen when you put a negative where there is supposed to be a positive.
If you put a negative thought where there should be a positive one 
you will not blow up, but you will not grow up into the version of yourself that you want to be.   
          </p>

          <p> 
            Negative thoughts cannot lead to a positive life. 
            In essence take a negative situation and see it from a different perspective. Instead of bad, call it good.
            The issue is not to say the bad thing is good but to believe that goodness will be the end result. 
            Hold on to God's word that all things will work together for good. 
            God has a plan to produce good from what you are facing. 
          </p>

          <p> 
            What is faith if not a filter that allows you to process your experiences through the goodness of God, choosing to reject what you see and clinging to what you trust he is doing?
Faith allows you to believe your beliefs and doubt your doubts. 
          </p>
          <p>
          You cannot live right if you do not think right.
          Let your thoughts and mind go through a screening process, “the best, not the worst; the beautiful, not the ugly; things to praise, not things to curse.” Philippians 4:8-9 MSG
