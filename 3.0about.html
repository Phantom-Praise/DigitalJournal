          <h1>Hi thanks for visiting my website</h1>
          <p>
            With over four years of technical experience in a number of industries 
            such as Cloud Computing(AWS), CyberSecurity, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Web Development, and Graphics Design. 
            I realized that many separate their technological career identity from who they are. 
            For this reason I decided to utilize my programming skills to showcase my identity by creating a digital diary that encompasses my career and faith.
          </p>

            <p>
            Currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Bowie State University and will be graduating by June 2026.
